# nekoget
A simple tool for getting images from NekosAPI. **(Linux ONLY)**

### Disclaimer
Do **NOT** rely on the maturity ratings too much, as the API does sometimes accidentally include NSFW material as "safe" or "suggestive". This is not something I can control, and I do not blame the team behind NekosAPI either.

### Another Disclaimer
Do not expect that many updates, since this project is quite small and simple.

### About the limit of Linux Only
Technically, it should **probably** work on Windows or others, however the download mechanism utilises **wget**.


## Installation
Well, this isn't hard. You can just download the script, add executable permission (`chmod +x /path/to/nekoget`), and then move it inside of `/usr/bin`.
However, you will need the *pyperclip* module, it's the only dependency apart from *Python* itself, and it's pre-installed libraries. *Pyperclip* is used for the copy url mechanism.

## Before you Ask..
### Why is the code written badly?
Because I am not an expert, and merely had a simple cool idea that I wanted to make happen. Like said in `--version`, ChatGPT made requesting, and then I built upon the simple request feature, to make it a full fledged cli tool.
