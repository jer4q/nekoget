# nekoget
A simple tool for getting images from NekosAPI. (Linux ONLY)

## Disclaimer
Do **NOT** rely on the maturity ratings too much, as the API does sometimes accidentally include NSFW material as "safe" or "suggestive". This is not something I can control, and I do not blame the team behind NekosAPI either.

## Another Disclaimer
Do not expect that many updates, since this project is quite small and simple.

# Installation
Well, this isn't be hard. You can just download the script, and move it inside of `/bin`.
However, you will need the *pyperclip* module, it's the only dependency apart from *Python* itself. *Pyperclip* is used for the copy url mechanism.

## About the limit of Linux Only
Technically, it should **probably** work on Windows or others, however the download mechanism utilises **wget**.
