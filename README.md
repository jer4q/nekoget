# nekoget
A simple tool for getting images from NekosAPI and yande.re. **(Linux ONLY)**

### Disclaimer
Do **NOT** rely on the maturity ratings too much, as the API does sometimes accidentally include NSFW material as "safe" or "suggestive". This is not something I can control, and I do not blame the team behind NekosAPI either.

### Another Disclaimer
Do not expect that many updates, since this project is quite small and simple.

## Installation
Well, this isn't hard. You can clone the source code, and run `makepkg -si` in the folder. This only works for Arch-based distributions, which are the only officially supported distribution type for now.

## Before you Ask..
### Why is the code written badly?
Because I am not an expert, and merely had a simple cool idea that I wanted to make happen. Like said in `--version`, ChatGPT made requesting, and then I built upon the simple request feature, to make it a full fledged cli tool.
